# CS 4102
 All of my work for CS 4102 (Algorithms) co-taught by Tom Horton and Mark Floryan in Spring 2022

CS 4102 covered topics such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, asymptotic analysis, graph problems, and reduction proofs.

I made this repository public on 14. February 2023 as the UVA CS department no longer offers CS 4102 after their transition to the new CS curriculum, so I figured that sharing this code won't be considered an honor violation. If you are a CS professor at UVA and think that my code being public could be considered an avenue for students to dishonestly copy code, please email me at wyz5rge@virginia.edu and I will me this repo private.
